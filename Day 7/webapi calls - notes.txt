As a API developer u work on

1. developing and publishing api (with different data source as required)
2. Consume the api and display data on your front end application (web, mobile, watch, desktop, console, library etc....)
	we will make api calls from ASP.net MVC application 
----------

there are 2 ways to make calls
	a. client side calls
		fetch api - web standard built into every browser, and used Javascript to make calls
			this is the fastest way to get the data, a little bit risky / unscerured for confendential data
			fetch api returns a promise it is very easy to use - has a try catch finally sintax
									           then catch finally
	b. server side calls
			HttpClient - also a web standard for server calls
			safest to use, a little bit slow than above one (as it needs hopping of server)
